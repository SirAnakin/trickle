trickle
=======

A simple library for composing asynchronous code. The main reason for it to exist is to make it
easier to create graphs of interconnected asynchronous calls, pushing the 'worrying about
concurrency' aspects into the framework rather than mixing it in with the business logic.

See [Examples.java](src/examples/java/com/spotify/trickle/example/Examples.java) for examples.
